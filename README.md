## 🌟 Why I Built This

In a world transitioning into AI, there are AI natives and those just starting their journey. AI speaks markdown (MD), but I found it surprisingly difficult for non-AI, non-IDE, non-native users to read and consume this content easily.

I struggled to find decent markdown readers that weren't shareware or freemium for basic features. We should have the fundamental ability to consume information without barriers, and it shouldn't be hard.

We want to share our creations and ideas and be able to do that easily without any friction. So I built this.

**Share. Use. Consume. All for free.**

Whether you want to introduce the world to AI, or let AI introduce you to new possibilities - you decide.

*This tool bridges the gap between AI-generated content and human consumption. No paywalls, no feature limitations, no friction. Just pure, accessible markdown reading for everyone.*
